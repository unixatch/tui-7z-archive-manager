- Added new commands: **info**, **create** and **help** (shortcuts only);
- Added new shortcuts for the new commands added;
- Added 2 new options:
  1. **skipToNewlyCreatedArchive**: when you finish creating the new archive, it'll show its contents directly;
  2. **backToMenuAfterCreatedArchive**: after creating the new archive, it just goes back to show the current archive instead of the new one;

- These new options have also parameters associated with them that also override them:
  1. **--skip**|**/skip**|**-s**|**/s**;
  2. **--back**|**/back**|**-b**|**/b**;
