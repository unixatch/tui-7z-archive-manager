# CHANGELOG v.1.3.5

- Adding a new command: **rename archive** + documentation;
  - Added a new shortcut: **_Shift + r_**;

- Added minimum **nodejs** version requirement;

- Renamed _createConfigJSON.mjs_ to _postinstall.mjs_
because it does more than it used to;

- Added a new tool for writing changelogs;

- Installation changes:
  - Added **auto-completion** files installation;
  - **bash** and **zsh** are supported;
  - now before installing or updating, it'll ask for permission;
  - now installations show a successuful message at the end;

- Added 4 QoL keys for 3 prompts:
  - **Home key**: goes to the top;
  - **End key**: goes to the bottom;
  - **Pageup key**: goes up by 3 items;
  - **Pagedown key**: goes down by 3 items;

- Simplified some regex;

- Changing _select_ prompt to a DIY one
because it couldn't clean the screen properly;
- moved around some cleaning functions;

- Moved all regexes regarding archive support to their own object for readability and performance;

- More asynchronous dynamic imports:
  - moved all modified prompts to separate files;

  - cleanups are now dynamically calculated instead of using static integers;
  - removed some unnecessary cleanups at the beginning;

- Fixed the path parameter for Termux:
  - **_/storage/emulated_** can't be used for permissions reasons,
  so it replaces it with Termux's provided linked path;

so it was changed to a _for...of_ loop instead;

- Fixed a crash caused by pressing tab on a folder that has its "children" property not yet prepared;
